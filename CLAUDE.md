# Video Editor - architecture rules

- ONE render function. `renderFrame(state, timeMs)` is used by
  BOTH the preview and the export. Never write a second one.
- All video decoding happens in a Web Worker. Main thread = UI only.
- Every VideoSample and every VideoFrame must be closed exactly once,
  in a `finally` block. mediabunny's `VideoSampleSink` returns a
  `VideoSample` - a wrapper that owns the underlying VideoFrame - not
  a raw VideoFrame. Closing the wrapper closes the frame it owns.
  `sample.toVideoFrame()` hands you a separate VideoFrame that you
  must close yourself, in addition to the sample.
  Leaking either will crash the browser tab.
- Timeline state is plain JSON. No class instances, no GPU objects.
- All time values are integers in MICROSECONDS. Never seconds,
  never floats.
- EXCEPTION: mediabunny's sink API speaks SECONDS as floats
  (`sink.getSample(timestamp)`, `sink.samples(start, end)`,
  `track.getFirstTimestamp()`). Convert at the sink boundary and
  nowhere else: microseconds -> seconds on the way in, and
  `sample.microsecondTimestamp` on the way out. Never let a float
  second value travel further into the app than the call site.
- Do not add a feature without a test.
